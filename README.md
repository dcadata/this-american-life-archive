# This American Life - Unofficial RSS Feed with Episodes 1 to Current

**[Unofficial RSS feed linked here](http://tal.ankar.io)** - you can subscribe with your podcatcher/RSS reader of choice

*[This American Life](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/about)* is a podcast/radio show. Its [official RSS feed](http://feed.thisamericanlife.org/talpodcast) serves only the most recent episodes. However, all podcast episodes are publicly available on the official website, even after they fall off the official RSS feed, which makes this project possible.

(This project was discontinued in September 2020 and restarted in April 2021.)
